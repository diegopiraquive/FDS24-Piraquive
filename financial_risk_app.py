### Instructions for Use
1. **Enter Client Information**:
    **Note:** An initial prediction can be made using just the Credit Score and Balance. However, including additional information may improve the predictionâ€™s accuracy and reliability.
   - **Credit Score**: Provide the normalized credit score of the client (range: 0 to 1).
   - **Balance**: Input the client's current account balance.
   - **Number of Products**: Enter the number of financial products the client uses with the bank.
   - **Has Credit Card**: Select whether the client has a credit card (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

2. **Make a Prediction**:
   - Click the **"Predict Churn"** button after filling out the fields.
   - The app will display the likelihood of the client churning as a percentage.

### Additional Information
- **Purpose**: This tool helps bank staff predict the likelihood of a client churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.
- **Model Accuracy**: The displayed model accuracy gives an idea of how reliable the predictions are based on historical data.
- **Data Privacy**: All inputs remain local to this app and are not stored or transmitted externally.
- **Limitations**: Predictions are based on statistical models and should be supplemented with your professional judgment and additional client data.
